## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: `arrayManipulation.js`

- **processArray**: Takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

### Task 2: `arrayManipulation.js`

- **formatArrayStrings**: Takes two arrays as arguments (an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`). Modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizes the entire string if the number is even, and converts the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

### Task 3: `userInfo.js`

- **createUserProfiles**: Takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2. Returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
